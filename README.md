## 📝 Biography
I received the M.Sc. degree in Micro and Nanoelectronics Engineering and the Ph.D. degree in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering from the Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona (UAB), Bellaterra, Spain, in 2013 and 2018 respectively. I have conducted research stays at the Pervasive Electromagnetics Lab of the Università degli studi di Roma “Tor Vergata” (2015-2016) and at the Esisar research center of the Grenoble-INP (France), as a postdoctoral researcher within the European ScattererID project (2018-2019). From 2019 to 2022, I enrolled the Ubiquitous computing Lab at the Universitat Pompeu Fabra as a project researcher in robotics. From 2022 to 2025, I was with the WiNe group of the Universitat Oberta de Catalunya as a Senior Postdoctoral Researcher. I worked as an Associate Lecturer at the Universitat Autonoma de Catalunya from 2019 to 2025. From 2025, I'm an Associate Professor at the Telecommunication and System Engineering Department at the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona.

I'm driven by a passion for engineering and am always looking for new challenges that allow me to leverage my skills while learning something new. When I'm not coding, you can find me playing guitar, singing or roller blading.
