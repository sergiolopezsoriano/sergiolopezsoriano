👋 Hi, I’m @sergio_lopez_soriano, PhD

I received the M.Sc. degree in Micro and Nanoelectronics Engineering and the Ph.D. degree in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering from the Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona (UAB), Bellaterra, Spain, in 2013 and 2018 respectively. I have conducted research stays at the Pervasive Electromagnetics Lab of the Università degli studi di Roma “Tor Vergata” (2015-2016) and at the Esisar research center of the Grenoble-INP (France), as a postdoctoral researcher within the European ScattererID project (2018-2019). From 2019 to 2022, I enrolled the Ubiquitous computing Lab at the Universitat Pompeu Fabra as an project researcher in robotics. I am currently a Senior Postdoctoral Researcher at the WiNe group of the Universitat Oberta de Catalunya. I also work as an Associate Lecturer at the Universitat Autonoma de Catalunya. 
 
👀 I’m interested in the broad adoption of passive sensors. 

🌱 I’m currently doing research on the integration of Ambient Internet of Things in 5G NR networks.

💞️ I’m looking for industrial partners in the telecommunications sector.
